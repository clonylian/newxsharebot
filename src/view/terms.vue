            Services. The Services provide a front-end interface (the "App")
            that display data that facilitates users interfacing with a set of
            decentralized open-sourced smart contracts that allow for the
            restaking of digital assets, such as Ether (ETH). These underlying
            smart contracts are referred to herein as the "Protocol". The
            Services also provide documentation available at
            <a
              href="https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >docs.eigenlayer.xyz</a
            >
            related to the App and Protocol ("Documentation"). The Protocol
            itself is not part of the Services, and your use of the Protocol is
            entirely at your own risk. Additionally, the third party
            technologies required to be used or interacted with in order to
            interact with the Protocol, including but not limited to a Wallet
            (as defined below, and collectively the "Third-Party Tools"), are
            not part of the Services, and your use of such Third-Party Tools are
            entirely at your own risk. The App is separate and distinct from the
            Protocol and any Third-Party Tools and is one such front-end
            interface but is not essential to accessing the Protocol. The App
            merely displays blockchain data and provides a web application that
            reduces the complexity of using the Third-Party Tools to or
            otherwise accessing the Protocol. All activity on the Protocol is
            run by permissionless smart contracts, and other developers are free
            to create their own interfaces to function with the Protocol.<a

            dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or
            claim (collectively, "Claim") relating in any way to the Services,
            including the App, any use or access or lack of access thereto, and
            any other usage of the Protocol even if interacted with outside of

            Rules") then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by
            reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms).

            Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal
            Arbitration Act ("FAA") governs the arbitrability of all disputes.
